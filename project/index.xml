      <description>The dataset I am using in this project pertains to various social factors and health insurance charges. Specifically, it looks at age, sex, bmi, number of children, whether or not they are a smoker, region they live in the US, and their yearly charges through health insurance. There are 7 variables total and 1338 observations. I am interested to see whether or not there is an interaction between all of these factors and how much individuals pay for their health insurance charges.</description>
